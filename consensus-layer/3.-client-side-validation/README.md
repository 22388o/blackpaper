# 3. Client-side-validation

The topics discussed in this chapter are not specific to RGB smart contracts design and can be leveraged and used by other protocols, all of which would form a family of client-side-validation protocols. One may see OpenTimeStamps as the first of the protocols in this sphere, with RGB being the second \*.

_\* other teams taking RGB ideas, sometimes “forgetting” to reference to their origin — like Lightning Labs with their CMYK protocol, lately renamed into “Taro” — are de facto using fruits of the client-side-validation development efforts over half of decade, fundraising on simplified and restricted versions of the work made by others._
