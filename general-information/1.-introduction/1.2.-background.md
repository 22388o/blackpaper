# 1.2. Background

Distributed protocols, like bitcoin, or more complex smart contract systems, need a way to synchronize the state across all multiple parties participating the protocol. Thus, operations under protocol must be organized in atomic transactions (or, more generally, state transitions) - and the sequence in which these operations are applied to an initial (genesis) state must be clearly defined. The rule of the ordering is named consensus rule, and the protocol having a well-defined consensus rule is named consensus protocol.

Blockchain has originated as a specific form utilized by distributed protocols (initially bitcoin) which combined both consensus mechanism with actual operations (transactions, in case of bitcoin), organized into a time-ordered chain (i.e. sequence), named ledger. Thus, bitcoin blockchain is a consensus (PoW Nakamoto consensus) plus transaction ledger, which finality and ordering is maintained by that consensus. The same applies to most of other existing blockchain.

It is quite clear that the main value for a distributed system is maintaining the consensus - event ordering - and not keeping the data of the actual events. Instead, it is sufficient to have a way how consensus layer may keep only short cryptographic commits to the ledger events, keeping/storing the actual event information (ledger) outside of the blockchain. This approach originates from Peter Todd works, and is named by him “client-side-validation”. It solves two major issues specific to any blockchain: scalability in terms of the size of the data kept onchain - and privacy, where the transaction graph is publicly known together with the actual transaction data. With client-side-validation we can again use blockchain for the single task it does well: consensus; moving the idea of keeping a ledger on it into an oblivion it deserves.
