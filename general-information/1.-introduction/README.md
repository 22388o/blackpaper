# 1. Introduction

This document is targeting technical readers, who would like to understand, audit, extend or build new applied tech with RGB. The document presents an explanation of design principles and provides deep technical insights into how RGB system is structured and works. It is not a formal RGB specification, however the information is based on underlying [LNPBPs](https://standards.lnp-bp.org/) standards defining parts of the RGB protocol and related technologies.
